              Brexit, short for British Exit, is the decision to leave the EU (European Union). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries. Why is the UK leaving? On the 23rd of June the UK held a public vote (referendum) and the leave side won with 52% of votes. <span class="w3-hide-small"> Now we are essentially hashing out our divorce (Withdrawl agreement) with the EU. This messy divorce has resulted in many delays on our departure from the EU and a new Prime Minister taking over. The new date set for us to leave is the 31st of October.</span></h4>

                   Boris Johnson is a very popular candidate for those in support of leaving the EU, which can be clearly seen in his victory speech, he promised he would "deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn" (the leader of the Labour Party, who are the Conservatives' rivals).</h4>

                    Often when thinking about Brexit we forget to think about how the rest of the EU reacted to the UK leaving. German chancellor Angela Merkel stated that "We take note of the British people's decision with regret. There is no doubt that this is a blow to Europe and to the European unification process." Whereas the French President at the time
                    'Francois Hollande' stated "This is a painful choice and it is deeply regrettable both for the UK and Europe. But this choice is theirs and we must respect it, accepting all the consequences."

                    <h4>  Brexit has divided the country that is  clear to see. Politics is being looked on with fear, anger and skeptisim. Those who supported leave believe this will help strengthen Britain and help it to reclaim its sovreignity. Those who beleived in remain are worried and want to ensure that the common person is not forgotten in the battle. Overall, it is essential that the public must remain vigilant and up to date on British Politics.</h4>
